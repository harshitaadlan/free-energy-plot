final_plot_week1.py:
	calculates free energy change for temperature difference of 0.1 and plots two graphs as follows:
		i) effective interfacial energy Vs. gibbs energy at temperature=0.8
		ii) ΔG/ΔT Vs. Gibbs energy at temperature=0.8
	extracts two .csv files named as "data_1" and "data_2" for temperature=0.8 and 0.9 respectively.
	each ".csv" files contains contact angle, interfacial energy and their standard deviations for each crystalline surface.
